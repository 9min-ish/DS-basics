# DS-basics
Data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science and programming. They are ways to store and organize data to enable efficient access and modification. Hereâ€™s an overview of the basics of data structures:

### Types of Data Structures

1. **Primitive Data Structures**
   - **Integers**: Whole numbers (e.g., -2, 0, 42).
   - **Floats**: Numbers with fractional parts (e.g., -3.14, 2.71).
   - **Characters**: Single letters or symbols (e.g., 'a', 'Z', '1').
   - **Booleans**: Binary values (e.g., True, False).

2. **Non-Primitive Data Structures**
   - **Arrays**: A collection of elements, typically of the same type, stored at contiguous memory locations. They allow random access to elements using an index.
     ```python
     arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
     ```

   - **Linked Lists**: A sequence of elements, where each element points to the next. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion.
     ```plaintext
     head -> [data | next] -> [data | next] -> NULL
     ```

   - **Stacks**: A collection of elements that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Operations are typically `push` (add an item) and `pop` (remove an item).
     ```python
     stack = []
     stack.append(1)  # push
     stack.pop()      # pop
     ```

   - **Queues**: A collection of elements that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Operations are typically `enqueue` (add an item) and `dequeue` (remove an item).
     ```python
     queue = []
     queue.append(1)  # enqueue
     queue.pop(0)     # dequeue
     ```

   - **Trees**: A hierarchical structure consisting of nodes, with a single root node and potentially many levels of additional nodes. Each node has zero or more child nodes.
     - **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children.
       ```plaintext
           1
          / \
         2   3
        / \
       4   5
       ```

   - **Graphs**: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted.
     ```plaintext
     (A)---(B)
      |   / |
      |  /  |
      | /   |
     (C)---(D)
     ```

   - **Hash Tables**: A collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. The keys are hashed to generate an index at which the value is stored.
     ```python
     hash_table = {}
     hash_table['key'] = 'value'
     ```

### Operations on Data Structures

1. **Insertion**: Adding a new element to the data structure.
2. **Deletion**: Removing an element from the data structure.
3. **Traversal**: Accessing each element of the data structure.
4. **Searching**: Finding an element in the data structure.
5. **Sorting**: Arranging elements in a specific order.

### Choosing the Right Data Structure

The choice of data structure depends on various factors such as:

- **Data size and complexity**: For small datasets, simple structures like arrays or linked lists might be sufficient. For larger datasets, more complex structures like trees or hash tables might be necessary.
- **Operations needed**: If frequent insertions and deletions are required, linked lists might be better than arrays. For fast search operations, hash tables or binary search trees might be more efficient.
- **Memory usage**: Some data structures, like arrays, use contiguous memory locations and can be more memory efficient. Others, like linked lists, require extra memory for pointers.

### Example Usage in Programming

Here are some common examples of how data structures are used in programming:

- **Arrays**: Used for storing a list of items like numbers, names, etc.
- **Linked Lists**: Used in scenarios where frequent insertions and deletions occur, such as in implementing queues.
- **Stacks**: Used for undo mechanisms in software, expression evaluation, and syntax parsing.
- **Queues**: Used in scheduling algorithms, managing requests in servers.
- **Trees**: Used in databases and file systems for hierarchical storage.
- **Graphs**: Used in networking, social networks, and solving pathfinding problems.
- **Hash Tables**: Used in implementing associative arrays, database indexing, and caches.

Understanding these basics provides a strong foundation for more advanced topics in computer science and efficient programming practices.
